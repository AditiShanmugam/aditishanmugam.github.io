                  <p class="level3">The aim of this research was to improve Anomaly Detection and Correction using
                    Superpixel Masking and Inpainting. To enhance existing methods, the network was designed by
                    employing a mask-based curriculum learning approach and incorporating multi-image exposure.
                    Two variants of the network were developed, taking inspiration from Generative Adversarial Networks
                    (GAN) and Autoencoder-based architectures. This work aims to improve applications such as image
                    restoration,
                    where damaged or missing parts of an image need to be reconstructed while maintaining the overall
                    image quality.

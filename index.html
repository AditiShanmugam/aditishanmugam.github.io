         [<i>Aditi Shanmugam, a Roboticist from Bangalore, India.</i>] </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from <a href="https://vtu.ac.in/en/" >Visveswaraya Technological University</a> in July '22. During my undergraduate journey, I had the privilege of gaining valuable professional experiences that significantly influenced my career path in the field of Robotics.
        I began my journey as a Data Science Fellow at <a href="https://www.fellowship.ai" >Fellowship.ai</a>, where I immersed myself in the intricacies of Machine Learning and AI, acquiring valuable skills and insights. I then had the opportunity to work as a research intern at the <a href="http://visual-computing.in/home/" >Visual Computing Lab</a> within the <a href="https://cds.iisc.ac.in" >Department of Computational Data Sciences</a> at the prestigious <a href="https://iisc.ac.in" >Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</a>. This role not only broadened my horizons but also deepened my understanding of advanced research in the field of Deep Learning.
        A brief yet impactful tenure as a Computer Vision intern at <a href="https://www.inferq.com/default.aspx" >Inferigence Quotient</a>, a trailblazing defense tech startup where my contributions were well-received, led to a full-time position as a Computer Vision Engineer, a role I currently hold.
        These diverse experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in Electronics, Telecommunications, and Data Science that renders me exceptionally proficient as a robotics engineer. </p>
